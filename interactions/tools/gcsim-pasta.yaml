    description: |-
      "**gcsim**"? Is that __*the*__ genshin combat damage simulator, inspired by the widely used World of Warcraft tool SimulationCraft, which can accurately calculate situational team DPS through a slick, easy-to-digest UI by executing action lists using customisable characters, weapons and artifact sets? Doesn't it also output a wide variety of useful charts such as reaction and damage distributions for each member of the team, alongside a fully viewable and modifiable debug screen where you can see frame by frame the inner workings of your favourite characters? 
      I was told that you can visit <https://docs.gcsim.app/guide/practical_guide> to get a solid understanding of how to use the tool and what it offers! 

      *Psst!* Don't forget to join the gcsim official discord for more inquiries and to discuss all things sim with likeminded individuals!
