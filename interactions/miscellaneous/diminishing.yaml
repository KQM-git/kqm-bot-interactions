  - title: Diminishing Returns (ATK% / DMG%)
    description: >-
      The only stat in the game subject to true diminishing returns is EM.
      Additional atk% and dmg% will always give the same flat increase in damage. 
      However, their value relative to each other and to other stats such as crit or EM depends on your initial stats,
      so it is important to consider opportunity costs of additional atk% and dmg% vs. other options for artifacts, weapons, and buffs.
      It is generally best to have a balance of all useful stats depending on the character.
      [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) can be helpful for comparing options to achieve this.
