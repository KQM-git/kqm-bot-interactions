    Those with the Guhua role are considered to be helpful and reliable people in
    the community. They generally have the most user-engagement out of any other pillar.
    \n\n**Mission Statement**\nIt is our job to accommodate members' needs based on
    inquiries or requests they have. We are trusted to be able to conduct ourselves
    with utmost open-mindedness and communication. \n\nWe tend to work in tandem with
    the Theorycrafting (Wangsheng) Pillar to convey information regarding all characters
    by condensing information into more digestible formats for KQM members."
